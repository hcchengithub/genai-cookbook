    "## ReAct Technique\n",
    "First introduced in a paper by [Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629), ReAct is a reasoning and acting paradigm that guides LLM to respond in a structured manager to complex queries. Reasoning and actions are interleaved and progressive, in the manner of chain of thought, so that LLM progresses from one result to another, using the previous answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.promptingguide.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freact.8e7c93ae.png&w=1920&q=75\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Results suggest that ReAct outperforms other leading methods in language and decision-making tasks, enhancing human understanding and trusting in large language models (LLMs). It is best when combined with chain-of-thought (CoT) steps as individual tasks with results being used for the next step, utilizing both internal knowledge and external information during reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first use a few-shot examples to indicate how an LLM should progress with its reasoning and acting to solve a complex query, requiring intermideiate results to progress to its final outcome\n",
    "\n",

The rate of ascent recommended for acclimatization varies, but it is generally accepted to be between 1,000 to 2,000 feet per day. The average time to climb the mountain allowing for proper acclimatization is usually between 7 to 9 days. This is because climbing routes are designed to help hikers acclimatize by following the \"climb high, sleep low\" principle, with rest days included. Given this, the exact number of days to reach the summit can vary depending on the route taken and the climber\\'s pace, but the general recommendation is to take it slow and allow for acclimatization rather than adhering to a strict number of ascending feet per day.',\n",

The rate of ascent recommended for acclimatization varies, but it is generally accepted to be between 1,000 to 2,000 feet per day. The average time to climb the mountain allowing for proper acclimatization is usually between 7 to 9 days. This is because climbing routes are designed to help hikers acclimatize by following the \"climb high, sleep low\" principle, with rest days included. Given this, the exact number of days to reach the summit can vary depending on the route taken and the climber's pace, but the general recommendation is to take it slow and allow for acclimatization rather than adhering to a strict number of ascending feet per day.\n",
