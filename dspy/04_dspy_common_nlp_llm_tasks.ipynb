    "### Quick overview DSPY Programming model\n",
    "DSPy is a framework for optimizing Language Model (LM) prompts and weights in complex systems, especially when using LMs multiple times within a pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of using LMs without DSPy involves breaking down problems into steps, prompting the LM effectively for each step, adjusting steps to work together, generating synthetic examples for tuning, and finetuning smaller LMs to reduce costs. This process is currently challenging and messy, requiring frequent changes to prompts or finetuning steps whenever the pipeline, LM, or data are altered. \n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy addresses these issues by separating program flow from LM parameters and introducing new optimizers that tune LM prompts and/or weights based on a desired metric. DSPy can train powerful models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as smaller models such as T5-base or Llama2-13b, to perform more reliably at tasks by optimizing their prompts and weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy optimizers generate custom instructions, few-shot prompts, and weight updates for each LM, creating a new paradigm where LMs and their prompts are treated as optimizable components of a larger learning system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DSPy enables less prompting, higher scores, and a more systematic approach to solving complex tasks using Language Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**: \n",
    "1. DSPy is a framework for optimizing LM prompts and weights in complex systems.\n",
    "2. Using LMs without DSPy requires breaking down problems into steps, prompting effectively, adjusting steps, generating synthetic examples, and finetuning smaller LMs.\n",
    "3. This process is challenging due to frequent changes needed when altering pipelines, LMs, or data.\n",
    "4. DSPy separates program flow from LM parameters and introduces new optimizers that tune prompts and weights based on a metric.\n",
    "5. DSPy can train powerful and smaller models to perform more reliably at tasks by optimizing their prompts and weights.\n",
    "6. DSPy optimizers generate custom instructions, few-shot prompts, and weight updates for each LM.\n",
    "7. This new paradigm treats LMs and their prompts as optimizable components of a larger learning system.\n",
    "8. Less prompting is required with DSPy, leading to higher scores\n",
    "9. The approach is more systematic and addresses the challenges of using LMs in complex systems.\n",
    "10. DSPy enables a new way to train and utilize Language Models effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A signature is a declarative specification of input/output behavior of a DSPy module. Signatures allow you to tell the LM what it needs to do, rather than specify how we should ask the LM to do it,\" states the docs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Signature is composition of three fields: \n",
    " * Task description\n",
    " * Input\n",
    " * Output\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/dspy_signature.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A Signature class abstracts the above and allows you to express your tasks, with its\n",
    "input and output (response). Internally, the framework converts a Signature class\n",
    "into a prompt. Declaratively specifying the specs, they define and dictate the behavior of any module we use in DSPy. All Siganture implementation details of \n",
    "Signature employed in the this notebook to carry out common NLP tasks are defined in [DSPy Utils file](./dspy_utils.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/class_based_prompt_creation.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation details of all the Signatures for this notebook to carry out\n",
    "all common NLP tasks is [DSPy Utils file](./dspy_utils.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Natural language processing (NLP) LLM Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks explored in this notebook, using sophiscated DSPy declarative\n",
    "signatures, show *how-to* code examples for common natural language understanfing capabilites of a generalized LLM, such as ChatGPT, OLlama, Mistral, and Llama 3 series:\n",
