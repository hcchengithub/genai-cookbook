    "### Quick overview DSPY Programming model\n",
    "DSPy is a framework for optimizing Language Model (LM) prompts and weights in complex systems, especially when using LMs multiple times within a pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of using LMs without DSPy involves breaking down problems into steps, prompting the LM effectively for each step, adjusting steps to work together, generating synthetic examples for tuning, and finetuning smaller LMs to reduce costs. This process is currently challenging and messy, requiring frequent changes to prompts or finetuning steps whenever the pipeline, LM, or data are altered. \n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy addresses these issues by separating program flow from LM parameters and introducing new optimizers that tune LM prompts and/or weights based on a desired metric. DSPy can train powerful models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as smaller models such as T5-base or Llama2-13b, to perform more reliably at tasks by optimizing their prompts and weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy optimizers generate custom instructions, few-shot prompts, and weight updates for each LM, creating a new paradigm where LMs and their prompts are treated as optimizable components of a larger learning system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DSPy enables less prompting, higher scores, and a more systematic approach to solving complex tasks using Language Models.\n",

    "**Summary**: \n",
    "1. DSPy is a framework for optimizing LM prompts and weights in complex systems.\n",
    "2. Using LMs without DSPy requires breaking down problems into steps, prompting effectively, adjusting steps, generating synthetic examples, and finetuning smaller LMs.\n",
    "3. This process is challenging due to frequent changes needed when altering pipelines, LMs, or data.\n",
    "4. DSPy separates program flow from LM parameters and introduces new optimizers that tune prompts and weights based on a metric.\n",
    "5. DSPy can train powerful and smaller models to perform more reliably at tasks by optimizing their prompts and weights.\n",
    "6. DSPy optimizers generate custom instructions, few-shot prompts, and weight updates for each LM.\n",
    "7. This new paradigm treats LMs and their prompts as optimizable components of a larger learning system.\n",

    "### Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A signature is a declarative specification of input/output behavior of a DSPy module. Signatures allow you to tell the LM what it needs to do, rather than specify how we should ask the LM to do it,\" states the docs.  \n",

      "Franklin spent hours poring over books about printing techniques and design principles. He practiced setting type by hand, perfecting his alignment and spacing. He experimented with different fonts and colors, seeking out the perfect combination for each project. And as he worked, he felt a deep sense of satisfaction and fulfillment that came from creating something tangible and beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Determined to turn his passion into a career, Franklin enrolled in a printing apprenticeship program. He spent long hours learning the ins and outs of the trade, from typesetting and proofreading to operating the presses and binding the finished products. And as he gained more experience and knowledge, he began to develop a reputation as a skilled and dedicated printer.\n",

And through it all, he remained committed to creating beautiful, high-quality printed materials that brought joy and inspiration to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Franklin's love of printing became more than just a hobby or a career – it was a lifelong passion that defined who he was and brought meaning and purpose to his life. And as he looked back on all that he had accomplished, he knew that he had made the right choice in following his heart and pursuing his dreams.\n",

      "Text: DSPy is a framework designed for enhancing the performance of Language Models (LM) in intricate systems, particularly when LMs are utilized multiple times within a pipeline. The conventional method of employing LMs without DSPy necessitates dividing problems into stages, crafting efficient prompts for each stage, aligning stages to collaborate, generating synthetic instances for fine-tuning, and fine-tuning smaller LMs to minimize expenses. This approach is laborious and disorganized, necessitating frequent modifications to prompts or fine-tuning steps whenever the pipeline, LM, or data undergo alterations. DSPy tackles these difficulties by segregating program flow from LM parameters and introducing innovative optimizers that adjust LM prompts and/or weights based on a specified metric. Capable of training powerful models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as smaller models such as T5-base or Llama2-13b, DSPy facilitates more dependable task execution by optimizing their prompts and weights. DSPy optimizers generate custom instructions, few-shot prompts, and weight updates for each LM, thereby establishing a novel paradigm where LMs and their prompts are regarded as adjustable components of a larger learning system. In essence, DSPy empowers fewer prompts, superior results, and a more methodical strategy to address complex tasks using Language Models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: 1. DSPy is a framework for optimizing LMs in intricate systems, especially when used multiple times within a pipeline.\n",
      "2. Traditional methods involve dividing problems into stages, crafting effective prompts, aligning stages, generating synthetic examples, and fine-tuning smaller LMs.\n",
      "3. This process is challenging and disorganized, requiring frequent modifications to prompts or fine-tuning steps due to pipeline, LM, or data changes.\n",
      "4. DSPy addresses these issues by separating program flow from LM parameters and introducing new optimizers for LM prompt and/or weight tuning.\n",
      "5. DSPy can train powerful models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as smaller models such as T5-base or Llama2-13b.\n",
      "6. Optimizing prompts and weights with DSPy leads to more reliable task execution and fewer required prompts.\n",
      "7. DSPy optimizers generate custom instructions, few-shot prompts, and weight updates for each LM.\n",
      "8. This paradigm treats LMs and their prompts as adjustable components of a larger learning system.\n",
      "9. DSPy enables less prompting, higher scores, and a more systematic approach to solving complex tasks using Language Models.\n",
      "10. By optimizing LM prompts and weights, DSPy improves task performance in complex systems.\n",
      "11. The new optimizers in DSPy are designed to address the challenges of working with multiple LMs in intricate systems.\n",
      "12. DSPy's innovative approach to LM optimization offers significant improvements over traditional methods.\n",
