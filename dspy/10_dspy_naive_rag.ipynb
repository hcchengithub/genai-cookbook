We need to identify the description of dark matter from a scientific and physical perspective, rather than its portrayal in fiction or other contexts. From the provided contexts, [3] \"Dark matter\" gives a detailed explanation of dark matter in the realm of physics. It describes dark matter as a hypothetical type of matter that is distinct from ordinary matter and is not directly observable through electromagnetic radiation. Its existence is inferred from various gravitational effects it has on visible matter and the universe.\n",

      "Answer: Dark matter is a hypothetical type of matter distinct from ordinary matter such as protons and neutrons, neutrinos, and dark energy. It does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, gravitational lensing, and its influence on the universe's large-scale structure, galaxies, and the cosmic microwave background.\n",
